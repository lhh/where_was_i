* Read in all files from the command line and combine information on
  placeIds prior to displaying information.
  * Some data I've run through this have a placeId which matches
    a known placeId, but the coordinates and/or address are both missing
* Allow run-time annotations which can then be stored in this git
  repository.
  * When we have a place ID with no address or just coordinates,
    allow the user time to check maps to input a zip code.
